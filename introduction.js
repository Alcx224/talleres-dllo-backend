let variable1 = 1;

//Semicolons are not mandatory in js but its good practice to use them
//Variables are mutable 

// you cannot asing new values to const and always must have something when declared
// + can be use to concatenate
// You can concatenate string and numbers cuz js was made in 10 days and will always convert that to string
// In js you can use, =, ==, ===
